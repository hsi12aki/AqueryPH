Saving marine lives today!

## About the project
This project uses digital technology, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI), to tackle the challenges of responsible tourism and its effects on marine life in the Philippines. As tourism grows, it is important to reduce its harmful impacts on delicate marine ecosystems. We are developing an easy-to-use app that employs a modified Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to gather and share important information about responsible tourism practices.


The app will help users quickly find tasks and data related to responsible tourism activities, making it a useful tool for both travelers and local communities. By using AI, the app will improve user experience and encourage sustainable practices that protect marine environments. It will provide links to conservation organizations, educational resources, and facts about how responsible tourism can benefit marine life, ensuring that users can make informed choices that support ecosystem health.
